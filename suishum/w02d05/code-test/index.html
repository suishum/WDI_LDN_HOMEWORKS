<!-- Front-end Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to provide candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. You are free to use any technology or libraries, and can provide any documentation for the work you have done. The more material you provide the better we will be able to evaluate your skills.

Objective:
The main objective is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a Fundraiser Meter component. You are allowed to use 3rd party libraries if needed.

Wireframe:

Requirements:
• Implement HTML structure of the wireframe above.
• The component has to be vertically and horizontally centered on the web page.
• On page load, the progress bar should be animated from zero to its current value.
• Add three buttons to donate values of “£1”, “£5”, “£10”.
• When the value changes, all the UI has to update accordingly

Bonus (optional):
Turn the wireframe into a visually stunning component. You can be as creative as you need i.e. applying modern design styles like Flat Design, CSS animations, etc...
Good luck & Happy Coding! -->
