# Angular Giphy AJAX

## Task

Consume the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/) using AngularJS (use the $http package for AJAX requests) and display some gifs on the page. You will need to get an API key from the Giphy website before you can make successful AJAX requests. [READ THE DOCUMENTATION](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).

It should look something like this:

## Requirements

* On load, the page should show the top 25 trending gifs.
* Users should be able to search for gifs and see the top results.

## Bonus

* Users should be able to load more gifs.

## Tips

* Before you worry about displaying the data, see if you can log it in the console.
* You may struggle to display the gifs at first, so log the data then dive in to find some suitable links for the src.
* Do any styling LAST.
