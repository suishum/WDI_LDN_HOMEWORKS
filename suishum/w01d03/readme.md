# CSS Layouts - Stack Overflow

## Instructions

Your task is to replicate a page from the Stack Overflow website using pure CSS.

[Use this page as your guide!] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8554043/what-is-a-clearfix)

Obviously there is a lot going on on this page, and we're not expecting you to template the whole thing. Try to reach something like the design below.

If you find this easy, keep going and see how much more you can replicate!

## Tips

* Remember what you have learned so far about floats and the box model as this stuff will really help.

* WIREFRAME... draw a diagram of the layout before you begin and have a think about what you'll need to do to make it work.

* Refer to the lesson notes or check out online resources like [CSS Tricks] (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) if you get stuck.

* Try using the Font Awesome library for the icons (but focus on the layout first). [Search for icons here] (http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and make sure to insert the following line of code in the head of your HTML:

```https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css```
