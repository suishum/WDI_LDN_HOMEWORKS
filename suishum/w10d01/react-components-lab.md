# React Components Lab

## Task

This lab is a chance for you to practice working with React components and passing state and functions down to components as props.

You are required to create a simple message board that allows a user to add a message. The messages should be looped through and displayed above.

It could look something like this:

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIcazcL.png"></p>

Your app should have a root `<App />` component, and smaller functional components for `<Messages />` and `<Form />`. These second two components can be 'dumb', functional components that receive props from the main App component.

## Bonus

* Write a function to delete messages.

## Tips

* Look back over your notes on functional and classical components and try to visualise the data flow.
