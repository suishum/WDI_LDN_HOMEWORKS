# RESTful App - Part 1

***

### Requirements

* Pick a resource that will be the focus of your app (not cheese).
* Set up an express app.
* Create a homepage, with a navbar with a link to your index page.
* Create an index page which loops over some static data and presents it on the page.
* Style your site with [Bulma] (https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/).

### Tips

* Use your notes in the GitBook, these provide you with a guide to setting up an express app with EJS views and partials.
* Don't copy and paste it from your classwork. You won't learn it this way and you will find it harder to resolve any issues later down the line.
* Check out the [CheeseBored] (https://cheesebored.herokuapp.com/) app, this is what we are working towards, but for now only worry about the homepage and index page.
