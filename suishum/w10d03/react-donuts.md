# RESTful React Donuts

## Task

Build a front-end application with React that consumes the [GA Donuts](https://ga-doughnuts.herokuapp.com/) API - no need to build your own! GA Donuts is a RESTful web API - more info on the endpoints you'll need to hit can be found at [https://ga-doughnuts.herokuapp.com/](https://ga-doughnuts.herokuapp.com/).

PLEASE NOTE: The API has been created for practice purposes so will act slightly differently to one's you have built yourself. Because everything's only stored in memory, you'll be able to PUT, DELETE, or POST and see the result as if the database were modified, but when you refresh or hit another endpoint it will be reset.

## Requirements

* Users should be able to view all donuts (index), view a single donut (show), add a new donut (new/create), edit a donut (edit/update) and delete a donut (delete).
* Your app should use React Router to navigate between components: `yarn add react-router-dom`
* Use Axios to make requests to the Donuts API: `yarn add axios`
* Use multiple components and use them sensibly - don't write the whole thing in your root `<App />` component!

## Bonus

* Style your app!
