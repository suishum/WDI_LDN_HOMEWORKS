In the starter code is a single HTML document, stylesheet and JS file (comment in the JS code to begin). If you open the `index.html` in the browser you'll see two watch faces.

#### Clock

The first watch face is a simple clock:

1. Add the current time to the watch face when the page is loaded (in the format `HH:MM:SS`)
2. Make the clock tick every second.

#### Timer

The second watch face is a timer with start/stop and reset buttons

1. Make the timer start when you click the red start/stop button
2. Make the timer stop if it is running and start if it is not with the same button
3. Stop and reset the timer with the black reset button
