# CSS Instagram Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com. Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Use display/floats and clears to position elements on the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The phones
  - App Store and Google Play links
  - Instagram logo


#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `style.css`. A Google font similar to the Instagram font has been linked in the head of the `index.html`, and has been applied to the body and inputs. It is up to you whether or not you want to include Normalize CSS or Reset CSS.

#### Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected result below:

####Font Awesome

There is a great resource for icons like the Facebook icon on the log in button, called [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). If you are interested, have a look at the 'Get Started' section, and add the [Facebook icon](http://fontawesome.io/icon/facebook-official/) to the button.

####Bonus

If you completed the first part of the homework and want to push yourself further, have a go at making the site responsive. You should add some CSS styles that are applied if the device is viewed on a screen smaller than 875px.

```CSS
@media only screen and (max-width: 875px) {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
```
