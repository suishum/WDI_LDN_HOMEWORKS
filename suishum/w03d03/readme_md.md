# JavaScript Game with Timer

Create a JavaScript game with the following rules:

* The player has 30 seconds to get as many sums correct as possible.
* Each time the player gets a sum correct their score should increase by 1.
* If they get a sum wrong, the score should decrease by 1.
* A new sum should randomly generate each time the user submits an answer.

### Requirements

* The game must be playable in the browser.
* You should use the timing methods `setTimeOut` and `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.
* You should display the users score.
* Use jQuery selectors to grab elements from the DOM.
* Update the DOM using `.html()` or `.text()`.
* Grab the value of the input field using `.val()`.
